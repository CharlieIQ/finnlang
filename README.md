# FinnLang üêï

> Yes, I named this after my dog

FinnLang is a simple, scripting language designed for learning interpreters and compiler basics. It supports basic variable declarations, expressions, control flow, and woofing. Also check out the gallery of dog pics.

## Running the web sandbox locally üê∂
>
>I made a web sandbox where you can play with FinnLang.

Here are the installation steps, enjoy!

*Note: Make sure you have the latest versions of **Cargo**, and **npm***

1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/finnlang.git
cd finnlang
```

1. Start the Backend Server
Navigate to the backend directory and run the Rust server:

```bash
cd backend
cargo run --bin server
```

This'll start the FinnLang backend on localhost. Default is port 3000, but you can change it in `server.rs`.

1. Set Up and Run the Frontend
In a new terminal window, go to the frontend sandbox directory:

```bash
cd ../finnlang-sandbox
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This should open the web sandbox in your browser at <http://localhost:5173> (or whatever Vite uses by default).

## How to use in a CLI üê∂

1. Write your finnlang code in a `.finn` file, for example:

```finnlang
let x = 0;
while (x < 5) {
    woof(x);
    x = x + 1;
}

woof("Hello world");
```

Save this as `file_name.finn` in the `./backend` folder.

1. Build and run the interpreter using Cargo:

```bash
cargo run -- file_name.finn
```

Replace `file_name.finn` with the path to your own `.finn` file if needed. (Or you can use your own file path)

1. Output will be printed to the terminal as your program executes.

## Language Features üêæ

### Types

- int ‚Äî 64-bit signed integers
- bool ‚Äî Boolean values: true or false
- string ‚Äî Double-quoted strings "hello"
- double ‚Äî Floating point numbers

### Expressions

Supports:

- Arithmetic: + for numbers and string concatenation
- Boolean logic: && (and), || (or), ! (not)
- Comparison: ==, !=, < (less than)

```finnlang
let a = 5 + 3;
let b = "Hello, " + "world!";
let c = (a == 8);
```

### Printing

Use `woof` to output values:

```finnlang
woof("Hello, world!");
let a = "HI";
woof(a);
```

### If, Elif, Else Statements

Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to declate conditionals. `elif` and `else` are entirely optional.

```finnlang
if (x < 0){
    woof("x is less than 0");
}elif (x == 5){
    woof("x is equal to 5");
}else{
    woof("x is something else");
}
```

### For Loops

Repeat code with initialization, condition, and update:

```finnlang
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i = i + 1) {
    woof(i);
}
```

### Functions

Define and call custom functions with the `funct` keyword:

```finnlang
// Function without parameters
funct sayHello() {
    woof("Hello, world!");
}

// Function with parameters
funct greet(name: string, age: int) {
    woof("Hello " + name + ", you are " + age + " years old!");
}

// Call functions
sayHello();
greet("Alice", 25);
```

### Comments

Support for single-line and multi-line comments:

```finnlang
// This is a single-line comment

/* 
   This is a multi-line comment
   that can span multiple lines
*/

let x = 5; // End-of-line comment
```

### While Loops

Repeat code while a condition is true:

```finnlang
let x = 0;
while (x < 5) {
    woof(x);
    x = x + 1;
}
```

### Arrays

You can declare arrays of data

```finnlang
let nums = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"];
```

### Assignment

Assign new values to existing variables:

```finnlang
let count = 10;
woof(count);
count = count + 1;
woof(count);
```

### Variable Declaration

Declare variables with `let`. (Type annotation is optional)

```finnlang
let x = 10;
let name: string = "Charlie";
let name2 = "Charlie";
let flag: bool = true;
```

## Features I want to add ü¶¥

- Better variable scoping
- Classes/OOP support
- A standard library with built in functions
